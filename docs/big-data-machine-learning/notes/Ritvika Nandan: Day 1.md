# Day 1

  Today, the first day of class, we talked about AI and its uses. We were put in breakout rooms, and we discussed how AI can analyze fight patterns. We used the fight scene bnetween Captain America and Iron Man in "Captain America: Civil War", and we talked about how Iron Man's suit used AI to determine Captain America's fight patterns. 
  The video we used is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKl4-zC1WZs).
